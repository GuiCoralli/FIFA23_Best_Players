## ðŸ’» Project

This project was developed as a way to fix the knowledge
Acquired during Stage 03 Rocketseat course lessons in Explorer.

## ðŸ“œ About:

Creation of interactive cards with information from FIFA 2023 players.

## ðŸ§  Learning:

With the creation of this project, independently, I was able to challenge myself and thus establish the
contents learned in Stage 03 - Explorer on Rocketseat's teaching platform.

## 1 - What I've learned?

Some fundamental concepts of CSS Grid and the behavior of its properties such as:

 - Fundamental properties of the Grid: `Grid Template Columns` `Grid Template Columns` `Grid Template Areas`;
 - Grid aligment properties: `align-content` `place-content` `align-items` `justify-items` `place-items`;
 - Auto properties : `grid-auto-flow`  `grid-auto-rows`   `grid-auto-columns`;
 - Card stylizaton: `card:hover img` `cursor: pointer` `transform: scale(1.1)`
 - Responsiveness: `rule mobile-first` `flexible measures (% and rem)`  `max-width` `@media (media queries)`

## 2- How did I apply?

Created in a practical way through a basic structure in HTML and a style in CSS, setting the main concepts of the CSS GRID that were applied in a WEB page
