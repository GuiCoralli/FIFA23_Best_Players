Some fundamental concepts of CSS Grid and the behavior of its properties such as:

 - Fundamental Properties of the Grid: (`Grid Template Columns`, `Grid Template Columns` e `Grid Template Areas`);
 - Grid Aligment Properties: `align-content`,`place-content`, `align-items`,`justify-items` e `place-items`;
 - Auto Properties : `grid-auto-flow`  - `grid-auto-rows` e  `grid-auto-columns`;
 - GRID OU FLEX
 - Card stylizaton: `card:hover img`, `cursor: pointer`, `transform: scale(1.1)`

## 2- How did I apply?

Created in a practical way through a basic structure in HTML and a style in CSS, setting the main concepts of the CSS GRID that were applied in a WEB page
